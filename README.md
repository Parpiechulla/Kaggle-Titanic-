Kaggle Titanic Descriptive Data Analysis and Survivor Prediction

Descriptive Analysis:
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of a number of passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others
In this analysis, we are taking a deep dive into a sample (train) data and looking for patterns or factors that play a role in chances of survival.

Predictive Analysis: 
After exploring the given data (train data) and making suitable inferences we make predictions on survival chances of other passengers (test data) using machine learning ensemble methods.
